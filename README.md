<h1>Project: Build a Landing Page</h1>
<h2>Udacity: Frontend Web Development Nanodegree</h2>
This project assignment was to utilize JavaScript and DOM to build a functional landing page.
<h3>Official Project Description</h3>
<blockquote>This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.<br><br>
For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. You should figure for every piece of functionality you add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring your code. If it takes you 3 hours to figure out the logic, it should likely take you another 3 hours determining that you wrote the best code possible. As your skills improve, this process will feel more natural. Make sure to remove any debugging code from your final submission.</blockquote>
